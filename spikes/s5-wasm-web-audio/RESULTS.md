## Task 1 — wasm32-unknown-unknown portability probe, 2026-09-05

Command:

    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release \
      -p namir-core -p namir-params -p namir-dsp -p namir-nam -p namir-ir -p namir-engine

Toolchain: `rustc 1.98.0 (88d9e12ae 2026-08-18)`

Result: **PASS**

Build finished in 11.50s (`Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 11.50s`),
zero warnings, zero errors. All six requested crates (`namir-core`, `namir-params`,
`namir-dsp`, `namir-nam`, `namir-ir`, `namir-engine`) and their transitive dependency
graph compiled for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with no edits to anything under `crates/`.

The known hazard named in the task brief —
`crates/namir-engine/src/telemetry_ring.rs:38`'s
`const _: () = assert!(cfg!(target_has_atomic = "64"), …)` — did not fire.
`target_has_atomic = "64"` holds on `wasm32-unknown-unknown` as predicted (LLVM
legalises 64-bit atomics to plain loads/stores on this single-threaded target).

Full transitive dependency set compiled (39 crates total, alphabetical by
first appearance): `autocfg`, `find-msvc-tools`, `shlex`, `proc-macro2`, `cfg-if`,
`constant_time_eq`, `arrayref`, `unicode-ident`, `arrayvec`, `quote`, `serde_core`,
`strength_reduce`, `zmij`, `bytemuck`, `serde_json`, `serde`, `itoa`, `memchr`,
`hound`, `rtrb`, `wide`, `cc`, `num-traits`, `blake3`, `syn`, `num-integer`,
`num-complex`, `transpose`, `primal-check`, `namir-core`, `rustfft`, `namir-dsp`,
`namir-params`, `realfft`, `rubato`, `serde_derive`, `namir-ir`, `namir-nam`,
`namir-engine`.

Nothing surprising beyond one minor note: `cc` and `find-msvc-tools` appear in
the graph (almost certainly pulled in by `blake3`'s optional native-intrinsics
build script for content hashing in `namir-core`). These only run as host-side
build-script tooling to decide whether to use a C backend; they did not block
or alter the wasm target output, and no MSVC toolchain issue surfaced. No other
platform-specific transitive dependency (no `cpal`, no `clack`, nothing naming
CLAP or a native audio backend) leaked into this crate subset — consistent with
D-5.1's layering table, since `namir-platform`/`namir-worker`/`namir-app`/
`namir-clap` were correctly excluded from the build.

**Verdict: kill criterion 1 does NOT trigger.** The spike may continue to Task 2.

## Task 2 — spike crate, shared harness, native reference figures, 2026-09-05

Files added: `Cargo.toml`, `src/harness.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/bin/native_bench.rs`,
`src/wasm_abi.rs` (see below), `.gitignore`. Transcribed from
`.superpowers/sdd/plan-s5-wasm-web-audio/task-2-brief.md` with two type-level
corrections the brief's code did not compile as written (`namir_core::SampleRate::new`
returns `Option`, not `Result`; `RingConsumer::try_pop` returns `Option`, not a
`Result` with a `.pop()` method) — both fixed in `harness.rs` without touching
anything under `crates/`. `src/wasm_abi.rs` is a placeholder empty module: `lib.rs`
(per the brief) declares `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")] mod wasm_abi;`, and Task 3
owns its contents, but Task 2 itself must produce a passing `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
lib build, which a missing module file would fail for a reason entirely internal to
this crate.

**Command:**

    cd spikes/s5-wasm-web-audio
    cargo build --release
    cargo run --release --bin native_bench

**Toolchain:** `rustc 1.98.0 (88d9e12ae 2026-08-18)` (same as Task 1).

**Machine:** AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, 32 logical CPUs — `docs/02-architecture.md` §2's
reference machine. `NAMIR_PIN_CORE` was left at its default (core 4).

**Was anything else running?** Yes — this session's own agent/tooling process was
active (issuing shell commands) during part of the run, specifically overlapping the
`a1_standard decaying` configuration; see the CONTAMINATED discussion below. Per
AGENTS.md's own benchmark-methodology section, this is a known, previously-documented
contamination source on this machine, not a first observation.

**Both builds:**
- Native `cargo build --release`: clean, no warnings.
- `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --lib` (from inside the spike
  directory): clean, no warnings. `namir-fixtures` and `core_affinity` do not enter the
  wasm dependency graph (both are `[target.'cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))'.dependencies]`
  in `Cargo.toml`), so no `getrandom`/host-only crate leaks into the wasm build.

**No figure below is a certified NFR-PERF-010 figure.** This spike does not link
`namir-platform`, so none of D-2.1/D-2.2/D-2.4's certified-benchmark apparatus applies
here beyond the borrowed methodology (single-core pin, warmup/measured counts,
percentile + estimator reduction) — every number below is informational only, for the
wasm-vs-native ratio Task 3 will compute, never a Namir performance claim on its own.

**\* `a1_standard decaying`'s five CONTAMINATED flags are not machine noise — read them
as signal-dependent cost, not as discardable.** The asymmetry rules out contamination
as the cause: all five `a2_lite decaying` reps, measured on the same machine in the
same run, are quotable; only `a1_standard`'s decaying reps flag. Across the five
`a1_standard` reps, `p50` rises from steady's ~6.4-6.6% to decaying's ~9.0-9.2% while
the per-residue estimator stays flat at ~9.9-10.4% in both signals — i.e. the *typical*
per-block cost gets measurably more expensive as the input amplitude decays toward
subnormals (this harness's `Signal::Decaying` drives the chain down to ~1e-30), while
the estimator (a periodic worst-case-block figure, insensitive to a slow amplitude
ramp) does not move. `is_quotable()`'s `p999 - estimator <= 5.0` rule was built to
catch *background* interference inflating the tail against an unmoving baseline
(D-2.4); here the baseline itself doesn't reflect the real ongoing cost increase, so
the same test fires for a different reason than it was designed to catch. These five
reps are reported as-is: **not** discarded as contaminated, and **not** quoted as if
`is_quotable()` had passed — the number is real, and the reason the flag fired is
stated here rather than left implicit.

**No `DenormalGuard` is active on this native run.** The spike depends on
`namir-core`/`namir-params`/`namir-dsp`/`namir-nam`/`namir-ir`/`namir-engine` and
deliberately excludes `namir-platform` (the only crate that installs FTZ/DAZ), so
nothing here enables the denormal guard shipped Namir installs at startup. That is the
right shape for this experiment — it isolates the wasm-vs-native comparison Task 3
needs rather than conflating it with a guard-vs-no-guard comparison — but it means the
`decaying` figures above (native's likely-subnormal-heavy branch cost) are **not**
representative of what shipped native Namir measures with its guard installed; expect
shipped Namir's decaying-signal cost to be flatter than this spike's.

### `native_bench_output.txt`

Committed deliberately as raw evidence (not gitignored), rather than only transcribing
the figures into this file by hand — it's the unedited console capture the numbers
above were copied from, and this project's own convention (see
`crates/namir-engine/benches/six_stage_chain.rs`'s M9b log, which keeps a disqualified
measurement set on the record rather than deleting it) favours keeping the primary
artifact rather than only its transcription.

### Fixtures written (gitignored, not committed)

`fixtures/a1_standard.nam`, `fixtures/a2_lite.nam`, `fixtures/ir_48k.wav`,
`fixtures/ir_44k1.wav`, `fixtures/reference_render_f32le.bin` — the last is the
deterministic reference render Task 3's wasm-vs-native output-parity check will
compare against.

**Verdict: proceed to Task 3.**
